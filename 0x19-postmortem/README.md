# Postmortem: The Great Sandbox Debacle of 2024

## Issue Summary
**Duration:** The outage lasted for approximately 3 hours, from 09:00 AM to 12:00 PM UTC on July 1, 2024.

**Impact:** Users were unable to upload media files to the YNS Task Management System. Approximately 70% of users attempting to add notes with media attachments experienced failure. Text-only notes were unaffected.

**Root Cause:** The root cause was a misconfigured file path, which directed media files to be saved outside the main application directory instead of within it.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Detailed Cause:** The root cause of the issue was a simple but devastating misconfiguration in the `add_note` function within the `app.py` file. The path for saving uploaded media files was directed to a location outside the main application directory. This misconfiguration caused the system to fail in creating and storing files.

**Detailed Fix:** The fix involved correctly setting the `upload_folder` variable to a subdirectory within the main application directory using the following code:

**python snippet**
    upload_folder = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'uploads' # this should be this 'static/uploads ' )
    if not os.path.exists(upload_folder):
       os.makedirs(upload_folder)

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes**:

Code Review: Implement regular code reviews to catch path misconfigurations early.
Automated Testing: Add automated tests to verify file upload functionality.
Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring to detect file upload errors promptly.

**TODO List:**

Patch app.py: Correct the file path for media uploads.
Automated Tests: Implement tests to ensure media files upload correctly.
Monitoring: Add tracking for file upload success and failure rates.
Code Review: Conduct a review to ensure similar issues are not present elsewhere.
Documentation Update: Highlight the importance of correct file path configurations.
